# Updates

Hey guys, I have finished all exams expect CIL and will start to update the later chapters soon:)

- Chaper 7 is on the notes! (Aug. 15)

# CIL-Notes-2020
Personal notes for Computational Intelligence Lab (CIL) 2020 by Prof. Thomas Hofmann at ETH Zurich

By Yu Fei

Motivated by some friends of mine, I started to write my personal lecture notes for this course which

- covers all stuff (I believe) on the slides
- add important remarks (I think) mentioned by Prof. Thomas Hofmann during the lectures but not on the slides
- connect things in each chapter together with motivations and detailed discussions (if they are correct) in a plain language
- add some supplementary materials (also reorganized with my own words) that I think are useful to get a deeper insight into some points

and Iâ€™d like to share it. It will be happy for me if it helps someone learn this course considering that it actually covers a lot of stuff.

The original plan of mine was complete it before sharing it, but it turns out that there is less time to do this than expected, and it took more effort to write it than expected as well. Up to this point, I have only finished the first 6 chapters, with a draft on chapter 7, which I didn't put in the one in the attachment. Despite the incompleteness, I think I will make more sense to share earlier. 

I will try to update it here with more chapters after my second exam on Aug. 12th and hopefully complete it by around Aug. 18th. Please leave some comments in the issue if you find some typos, something needs to be clarified more, or willing to provide suggestions on organizing stuff and writing style. I will fix those once I get some time.

After I finish it, I will share the .tex file with all the figures as well. 

It's a lot of fun to write this stuff.
